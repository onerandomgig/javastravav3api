/**
 * <h2>Authentication</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Strava uses OAuth2 as an authentication protocol. It allows external applications to request authorisation to a user's private data without requiring their
 * Strava username and password. It allows users to grant and revoke API access on a per-application basis and keeps users' authentication details safe.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All developers need to register their application before getting started. A registered application will be assigned a Client ID and Client SECRET. The SECRET
 * should never be shared.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Web Application Flow</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The process begins by redirecting a browser to a Strava URL with a set of query parameters that indicate the type of Strava API access the application
 * requires. Strava handles the user authentication and consent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the user authorises the application, Strava will return an authorisation code to the web server application. The application must still complete the
 * process by exchanging the code for an access token.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is done by presenting a client_id and client_secret (obtained during application registration), along with the authorisation code, to Strava. Upon
 * success, an access token will be returned that can be used to access the API on behalf of the user.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Users can revoke access on their settings page.
 * </p>
