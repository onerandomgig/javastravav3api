/**
 * <p>
 * API implementation of the Strava webhook events API
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Webhook push subscriptions allow an application to subscribe to events that occur within Strava’s infrastructure. These events are pushed to a URL designated by the subscription. Webhooks allow an application to update athletes in real-time, and implement smarter data fetching.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Requests to the subscription endpoint are made using the client_id and client_secret of the application because requests are made on behalf of an application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This API is only available to select applications. To request access please contact developers@strava.com
 * </p>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://strava.github.io/api/partner/v3/events/">http://strava.github.io/api/partner/v3/events/</a>
